Question 7: Consider the following code and find the output and Explain it in breif.
A. String s1 = "Java";
B. String s2 = "Java";
C. StringBuilder sb1 = new StringBuilder();
D. sb1.append("Ja").append("va");

E. System.out.println(s1 == s2);
F. System.out.println(s1.equals(s2));
G. System.out.println(sb1.toString() == s1);
H. System.out.println(sb1.toString().equals(s1));
Answer:
a. true is printed out exactly once.
b. true is printed out exactly twice.
c. true is printed out exactly three times.
d. true is printed out exactly four times.
e. The code does not compile.


Answer: c. true is printed out exactly three times.
because:  System.out.println(s1 == s2);: true (since s1 and s2 are interned and refer to the same object).
          System.out.println(s1.equals(s2));: true (since both strings have the same content).
          System.out.println(sb1.toString() == s1);: false (since sb1.toString() creates a new string object).
          System.out.println(sb1.toString().equals(s1));: true (since both strings have the same content).
