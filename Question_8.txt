Question 8: What will be the output of the following code and why?
public class _C
{ private static int $;
public static void main(String main[])
{
String a_b;
System.out.print($);
System.out.print(a_b);
}
}

Answer:
(a) Compiler error at line 1.
(b) Compiler error at line 2.
(c) Compiler error at line 4.
(d) Compiler error at line 5.
(e) Compiler error at line 8.




Answer is: (e) Compiler error at line 8.
because, 
Line 1: The declaration of the class _C is correct. There is no compiler error at line 1.
Line 2: The declaration of the static integer variable $ is correct. There is no compiler error at line 2.
Line 4: The declaration of the local variable a_b is correct. There is no compiler error at line 4.
Line 5: The System.out.print($); statement is correct and will print 0. There is no compiler error at line 5.
Line 8: The System.out.print(a_b); statement will cause a compiler error because a_b is not initialized before use. The compiler requires local variables to be initialized.
